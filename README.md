# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This website showcases some of my projects in web development. 

Please note: This portfolio is still a work in progress, with many pages still left unfinished as I continue to learn more. I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio website. Thank you for visiting! Anyways, back to the good stuff.

The website is divided into four sections: 

## Home

The "Home" page is an introductory page that includes links to all of the other pages. Pretty simple I'd say.

## About

The "About" page includes a short description about me, such as my education, interests, and hobbies, My relevant socials are also included here - GitHub, LinkedIn, and Etsy.

## Projects

The "Projects" page displays my recent works, though it isn't many published ones at the moment. This page has been future-proofed for when more are created. The title, image, and a link to GitHub are included for each project that can include it.

## Contact

The "Contact" page allows for others to send a message using a form, or access my relevant socials like the about page.
